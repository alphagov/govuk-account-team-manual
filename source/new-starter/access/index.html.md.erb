## Get access to Splunk

To access Splunk, raise a IT request:

1. Sign in to the [GDS IT & Estates Web Help Desk](https://gdshelpdesk.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/helpdesk/WebObjects/Helpdesk.woa).
1. In __Request Type__, select __GDS IT Requests__ > __People & accounts__ > __Other Account Requests__.
1. In __Request Detail__, enter "Please apply gds-027-govuk-accounts role to my google account."
1. For __Account type__, select __LDAP__.

## Check access to the GOV.UK Account Grafana dashboard

Check that you have access to the [GOV.UK Account Grafana dashboard](https://grafana-paas.cloudapps.digital/d/_g_9aRoMk/gov-uk-accounts).

If you cannot access this dashboard, speak to IT using Slack or [raise an IT request](https://gdshelpdesk.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/helpdesk/WebObjects/Helpdesk.woa).

## Give GOV.UK Seal access to your Github name

The Account team use [Seal Slack bot](https://github.com/alphagov/seal) to give helpful prompts on Slack. One example is the morning reminder for pull requests that require review.

Seal needs to know which GitHub user is in which team. This configuration is described in the [Seal alphagov.yml file](https://github.com/alphagov/seal/blob/master/config/alphagov.yml#L128-L162).

If your username is not already on the list, add your username to the list and raise a pull request, asking other team members to review.

Once the pull request has been merged, the change is automatically deployed to the heroku app.

See this [example Seal pull request](https://github.com/alphagov/seal/pull/205/files) for reference.
