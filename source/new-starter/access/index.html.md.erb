## Give GOV.UK Seal access to your Github name

The Account team use [Seal Slack bot](https://github.com/alphagov/seal) to give helpful prompts on Slack. One example is the morning reminder for pull requests that require review.

Seal needs to know which GitHub user is in which team. This configuration is described in the [Seal alphagov.yml file](https://github.com/alphagov/seal/blob/master/config/alphagov.yml).

If your username is not already on the list, add your username to the list and raise a pull request, asking other team members to review.

Once the pull request has been merged, the change is automatically deployed to the heroku app.

See this [example Seal pull request](https://github.com/alphagov/seal/pull/205/files) for reference.
