# Set up the GOV.UK account manager prototype

The GOV.UK account manager prototype and attribute store are a central part of GOV.UK Accounts.

You can find out more about how they work with other services in [How GOV.UK Accounts works](/new-starter/how-it-works/#how-gov-uk-accounts-works).

This content tells you how to:

- set up and run the GOV.UK account manager prototype and attribute store locally
- integrate the `finder-frontend` Brexit checker with the GOV.UK account manager and attribute store

This content is for GOV.UK developers working on Macs or Linux. If you are not a GOV.UK developer, you cannot use this prototype.

## Install GOV.UK Docker

[Install GOV.UK Docker](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-docker/blob/master/docs/installation.md). Make sure that you allocate at least the minimum resources specified in the [GOV.UK Docker settings guidance](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-docker/blob/master/docs/installation.md#docker-settings) as running the prototype on your local machine is resource-intensive.

## Clone repositories to local machine

To set up GOV.UK account manager, clone the following repositories (repos) to the `~/govuk` folder on your local machine:

- the [GOV.UK account manager prototype](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-account-manager-prototype)
- the [GOV.UK attribute service prototype](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-attribute-service-prototype)
- the [finder frontend](https://github.com/alphagov/finder-frontend) that contains the Brexit checker
- the [email alert API](https://github.com/alphagov/email-alert-api/)

You [create the `~/govuk` folder](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-docker/#installation) when you install GOV.UK Docker.

Check out the following branches on the different repos:

- `master` branch on the GOV.UK Docker repo
- `main` branch on the GOV.UK account manager prototype repo
- `main` branch on the GOV.UK attribute service prototype repo
- `master` branch on the Brexit checker repo

## Set up the docker image and database

In the command line, go to the `govuk/govuk-docker` repo folder and run the following commands:

- `make govuk-attribute-service-prototype`
- `make govuk-account-manager-prototype`
- `make finder-frontend`
- `make email-alert-api`

These commands set up a docker image, build the required system and gem dependencies, and set up the database.

## Run the GOV.UK account manager prototype and attribute store

You can run the GOV.UK account manager prototype and attribute store locally without also running the Brexit checker.

You can run every feature of the prototype locally, however:

- the registration journey will not transfer data from the checker
- the account will not contain any user data

In the command line, run `govuk-docker up govuk-account-manager-prototype-app`. Running this command starts the:

- `govuk-account-manager-prototype` app
- `govuk-attribute-service-prototype` app
- background services required for these apps to work

This command also configures these 2 applications so that they communicate with each other.

Go to `http://www.login.service.dev.gov.uk/sign-in` in your web browser.

If you have set up the apps correctly, you will be able to register a new account, or sign in if you have already created one.

You have now set up and run the GOV.UK account manager prototype and attribute store.

## Run the Brexit checker with the GOV.UK account manager prototype and attribute store

To register a new GOV.UK account, most users arrive through the Brexit checker. Without data from the checker, the user's dashboard will not show any integrations with GOV.UK services.

You can run the GOV.UK account manager prototype, attribute store and Brexit checker locally. To do this, you use `govuk-docker` to start all apps needed for the full user registration journey.

In the command line, run `govuk-docker up finder-frontend-app-account`. Running this command starts the:

- `finder-frontend` app, which contains the checker
- `govuk-account-manager-prototype` app
- `govuk-attribute-service-prototype` app
- background services required for these apps to work

This command also configures these apps so that they can communicate with each other.

Go to `https://finder-frontend.dev.gov.uk` in your web browser.

If you have set up the apps correctly, you will be able to access the following links:

- the [Brexit checker journey start page](http://finder-frontend.dev.gov.uk/transition-check/questions)
- the [Brexit checker results page](http://finder-frontend.dev.gov.uk/transition-check/results?c[]=living-ie) that reflects the answers you give during the Brexit checker journey
- select the subscribe banner or button to access the [account sign up page](http://finder-frontend.dev.gov.uk/transition-check/save-your-results?c%5B%5D=living-ie)

When you have set up your local account, you can [sign into your account](http://www.login.service.dev.gov.uk/) and view the manage screens.

You have now successfully

- set up and run the GOV.UK account manager prototype and attribute store
- integrated the `finder-frontend` Brexit transition checker with the account manager app

## Resolve issues

If you are having issues setting up and running the GOV.UK account manager prototype, it might be because:

- you have not allocated enough resources to GOV.UK Docker
- there have been backend changes to the database or the prototypes
- there have been [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) configuration changes to the app

### Not enough resources allocated to GOV.UK Docker

To change the resource allocation for GOV.UK Docker, see the [GOV.UK Docker readme](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-docker/blob/master/README.md#installation).

### Backend changes to the database or the prototypes

To account for recent backend changes, go to the main branch of your local GOV.UK Docker repo and run the following in the command line:

```
govuk-docker run govuk-account-manager-prototype-lite bundle exec rake db:migrate
govuk-docker run govuk-account-manager-prototype-lite bundle exec rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=test
```

Then restart the account manager and, if necessary, Brexit transition checker prototype apps.

### Ruby on Rails configuration changes to the app

If there have been Ruby on Rails configuration changes to the GOV.UK account manager prototype app, you must restart the app.

1. Run `govuk-docker down` in the command line to stop all GOV.UK Docker containers.
1. Run `govuk-docker-up` in the folder of the app to restart the GOV.UK Docker containers.
