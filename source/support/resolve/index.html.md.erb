# Resolve issues with GOV.UK Account

If you are the on-call support developer, you may receive an alert if
there is a problem with GOV.UK Account.  The Senior Management Team
(SMT) may also contact you if you need to scale up GOV.UK Account at
short notice.

This content covers the reasons you may get called and what to do in
each case.

## Prerequisites

Before going on call, make sure you have access to everything you
might need and know where our code is.

### Get access to the GOV.UK PaaS

1. Sign up to the [London PaaS instance][paas].

2. Ask `#govuk-accounts-tech` to give you the [space developer
   role][paas-permissions] in the "production" space for the
   "govuk-accounts" organisation.

3. Set up the [Cloud Foundry CLI][cf-cli].

4. Check you can log in to the PaaS space:

   ```
   $ cf login -a api.london.cloud.service.gov.uk --sso
   ```

[cf-cli]: https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/get_started.html#set-up-the-cloud-foundry-command-line
[paas]: https://admin.london.cloud.service.gov.uk
[paas-permissions]: https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/orgs_spaces_users.html#space-developer

### Repositories

The following sections contain information on our repositories.

#### GOV.UK Account Manager Prototype

Handles user interactions with accounts (e.g. logging in, signing up,
brokering attribute store data, seeing "their dashboard").

See the [GOV.UK Account Manager Prototype GitHub repository][repo-account-manager] for more information.

#### GOV.UK Attribute Service Prototype

A key-value store for user attributes. This prototype currently only stores users' checker answers.

See the [GOV.UK Attribute Service Prototype GitHub repository][repo-attribute-service] for more information.

#### GOV.UK Account Architecture

Contains information on how the system architecture works.

See the [GOV.UK Account Architecture GitHub repository][repo-architecture] for more information.

#### GOV.UK Account Tech Docs

Contains our technical documentation.

See the [GOV.UK Account Tech Docs GitHub repository][repo-docs] for more information.

#### GOV.UK Docker

You can spin up a local development version of the account system,
including the transition checker integration, with the latest GOV.UK
Docker.

See the [GOV.UK Docker GitHub repository][repo-govuk-docker] for more information.

## Diagnosing the problem

Try to determine which app is having issues and what the nature of the
problem is:

1. Check for `govuk-account-manager` and `govuk-attribute-service`
   errors in [Sentry][sentry] (also sent to `#govuk-accounts-tech`).

2. Connect to the office VPN and check the metrics in
   [Grafana][grafana].

The apps communicate, so a problem in one could cascade to the other.

[grafana]: https://grafana-paas.cloudapps.digital/d/_g_9aRoMk/gov-uk-accounts
[sentry]: https://sentry.io/govuk

## Solving the problem

GOV.UK Account is still part of GOV.UK, so make sure to follow the
[GOV.UK developer documentation incident guidance][incident], in addition to diagnosing and
fixing any accounts-specific issue.

[incident]: https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/manual/incident-what-to-do.html

### There's a problem with the PaaS

If the problem is with the PaaS itself (for example, requests are not
even making it to the app, despite the app being healthy), you can
escalate the issue to the PaaS on-call support.

See [the PaaS support page][paas-support] and [rota][paas-rota] for more information.

[paas-support]: https://admin.cloud.service.gov.uk/support
[paas-rota]: https://rotas.cloudapps.digital/

### Someone is attacking us

See the section on security incidents in the [GOV.UK developer documentation incident
guidance][incident] for more information.

### An app is unable to keep up with the volume of requests

If an app is receiving more requests than it can handle, you can scale
that app up by:

- changing the deployment pipeline
- using the Cloud Foundry CLI

If you are adding more then 50GB of RAM then please let PaaS know (in
`#paas`) as they may need to scale to accommodate our new usage.

See also the following [continuous deployment documentation](#notes-on-continuous-deployment).

#### Change the deployment pipeline

You change the deployment pipeline by editing the
`concourse/pipeline.yml` file.

See the [example pull request][example-pr] for more information.

[example-pr]: https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-account-manager-prototype/pull/464

#### Using the Cloud Foundry CLI

Run the following commands:

```
$ cf scale -i <number of app instances> <app name>
$ cf scale --process worker -i <number of worker instances> <app name>
```

The `<app name>` is either `govuk-account-manager` or
`govuk-attribute-service`.

### Postgres or Redis is unable to keep up

We have one Redis instance, used by the Account Manager, and 2
Postgres instances, one for each app.

You can list them by running

```
$ cf services
```

If one of these needs to scale up, for example:

- new Sidekiq jobs cannot be enqueued because Redis is out of memory
- new users or attributes cannot be stored because Postgres is out of disk space

You can do so with

```
$ cf update-service <service name> -p <plan name>
```

To list all plans, run `cf marketplace`.

See the [GOV.UK PaaS documentation on scaling Postgres][scale-postgres] and [scaling
Redis][scale-redis] for more information.

[scale-postgres]: https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/deploying_services/postgresql/#upgrade-postgresql-service-plan
[scale-redis]: https://docs.cloud.service.gov.uk/deploying_services/redis/#upgrade-redis-service-plan

### There is a bug in the code

If there are a large number of Sentry errors, there may be a bug in
the code which has suddenly reared its head (for example, maybe it
only happens on certain pages, and a link to such a page has been
tweeted).

If you can track down the bug and fix it, please do!

See also the following [continuous deployment documentation](#notes-on-continuous-deployment).

## Nuclear options

### I need to suspend the Account Manager

See the [documentation on suspending GOV.UK Account](/support/toggle-accounts/#suspend-and-resume-gov-uk-account) for more information.

### I need to turn off the Transition Checker integration

The accounts functionality on GOV.UK is enabled by 2 feature flags,
set in puppet.

Set these to false to disable the integration:

```yaml
govuk::apps::collections::feature_flag_accounts: false
govuk::apps::finder_frontend::feature_flag_accounts: false
```

Then deploy Puppet.

You can manually run Puppet on all the `frontend` and
`calculators_frontend` machines if you don't want to wait for the
normal run:

```bash
GOVUK_ENV=production

for GOVUK_CLASS in frontend calculators_frontend; do
  n=0
  for node in $(gds govuk connect ssh -e "$GOVUK_ENV" aws/jumpbox -- govuk_node_list -c "$GOVUK_CLASS"); do
    n=$((n+1))
    gds govuk connect ssh -e "$GOVUK_ENV" "aws/${GOVUK_CLASS}:${n}" -- govuk_puppet --verbose
  done
done
```

## Notes on continuous deployment

Our applications are continuously deployed via [Concourse][cd]:

- [`govuk-account-manager-prototype` pipeline][cd-account-manager]
- [`govuk-attribute-service-prototype` pipeline][cd-attribute-service]

The pipelines both deploy code and also scale the app.  This means
that:

- if you make a code change, that change will deploy automatically
  after being merged

- if you scale the app by editing the pipeline, that change will
  automatically deploy after being merged

- if you scale the app through the Cloud Foundry CLI, the app will
  scale back down when the next deployment happens.

You can disable automatic deployments by pausing the relevant pipeline.
Select the pause button in the top-right corner (next to your
username) of the pipeline. A paused pipeline turns blue.
