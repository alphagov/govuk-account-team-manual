# Send an email to all GOV.UK Account users

Hello Christina.

Sometimes you may need to email all GOV.UK Account users. For example, after a request from the Senior Management Team (SMT).

## Send an email

1. Sign in to production.

    If you are already signed in to CloudFoundry:

    ```
    cf target -s production
    ```

    If you are not already signed in to CloudFoundry:

    ```
    cf login -a api.london.cloud.service.gov.uk --sso -o govuk-accounts -s production
    ```

2. SSH into a production machine:

    ```
    cf ssh govuk-account-manager
    ```

2. Load the application environment:

    ```
    $ /tmp/lifecycle/shell
    ```

3. Open a [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) console:

    ```
    $ rails c
    ```

4. Assign the email subject and content to variables:

    ```
    subject = "<email-subject-line>"
    body = "<email-body-text>"
    ```

    For example:

    ```
    subject = "Important changes to your GOV.UK Account"
    body = "You must perform an action"
    ```

5. Trigger an email to all account users:

    ```
    User.all.each do |user|
      UserMailer.with(email: user.email, subject: subject, body: body).adhoc_email.deliver_later
    end
    ```

6. Check the emails have begun to appear in the [GOV.UK Notify dashboard][notify-dashboard].
