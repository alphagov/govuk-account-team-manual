# Respond to data protection requests

When we use and hold user data, users gain rights under the UK General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR).
Users make requests to exercise those rights and we have responsibilities to respond.

This guidance describes some scenarios we must be prepared for, along with information on responsibilities between teams.

Responding to requests may involve the GDS Digital Identity Program, GOV.UK Accounts team, GOV.UK User Support and the GDS Privacy Office.

This guide is not a complete list of everything we must do under the UK GDPR. Instead it focuses on user rights
requests and how to respond.

## Who handles requests

Before October 2021 the a large part of work around rights requests was handled by the GOV.UK Accounts team.

Since then we have migrated data to the GDS Digital Identity programme's Single Sign On (SSO) product.

Digital Identity's SSO is now the canonical source for user data, as well as the point at which we should initiate any deletion requests.

GDPR requests recieved by User Support, the GDS Privacy office or GOV.UK 2ndline should now be forwarded to the Digital Identity zendesk queue `GOV.UK Sign In`

## GOV.UK accounts team

In rarer cases the GOV.UK accounts team may need to assist Digital Identity in meeting some rights requests.

Where a partial restriction, or selective delete request is proposed that applies to GOV.UK Account data, developers on the team may need to intervene.

Additionally the GOV.UK Account team may need to provide any information that is not visible to Digital Identity during a Subject Access Request.
However Digital Identity should be the first point of contact as they can perform basic checks around if a user has an account or not, before moving on to fulfill any request.
