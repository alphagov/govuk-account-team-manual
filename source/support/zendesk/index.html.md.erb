# Solve Zendesk tickets

## How Zendesk tickets are assigned to the GOV.UK Account team

When a user submits a public feedback form, this creates a Zendesk ticket in the GOV.UK second line escalation support queue.

The GOV.UK second line escalation support team sends GOV.UK Account-specific tickets to the GOV.UK Account team by assigning those tickets to __2nd line Accounts__ in Zendesk. GOV.UK Account-specific tickets can be about:

- feedback on the account
- a technical issue a user is having
- feedback on the Brexit checker

The owners of GOV.UK Account second line support in Zendesk are the team delivery manager and product manager. They are responsible for the tickets, macros and prepared responses.

## Respond to and solve tickets

There’s a [GOV.UK Account team rota](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cfoRyupvHzIqrcdes_JwQh_qbuwCiNqIuMt_iTDz8Tc/edit#gid=1167069729) for dealing with support tickets.

There’s usually 2 people on the rota every day: one technical person and one non-technical person.

When you’re on the rota, you should spend about an hour a day working through tickets.

### Our SLA for responding to or resolving tickets

Ideally we should respond to or solve:

- new tickets within 2 working days
- open tickets within 5 working days
- pending tickets within 5 working days

### Prioritise tickets

Work through tickets in this order:

1. New tickets.
2. Open tickets.
3. Pending tickets that have not been updated in 5 working days or more.

It helps if you order the tickets by the __Requested__ field in Zendesk.

## Solve new and open tickets

How you solve new and open tickets differs depending on what the ticket is about.

### If the ticket is about feedback on the account (negative or positive)

#### If the ticket is anonymous

1. Add the __govuk_account_brexit__ tag to the ticket.
1. Add an internal note to explain why you’re solving it. For example: "A bit of positive feedback. Solving this ticket because we don’t need to do anything."
1. Submit the ticket as __solved__ using the dropdown at the bottom.
1. If the feedback in the ticket points to something we can improve or change, add a card to __ready to be prioritised__ in our [backlog trello board](https://trello.com/b/c85oxVeR/backlog-accounts) so the team can discuss it at pre-planning. If you’re not sure it merits a card, ask the team in the team slack channel.

#### If the user left their name and contact details

We have a macro for asking users for more feedback. You must:

1. Respond to the user using the [__GOV.UK Account::Additional feedback requested__ macro](#gov-uk-account-additional-feedback-requested).
1. Record the ticket in the [__Asked for feedback__ tab in the feedback spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cfoRyupvHzIqrcdes_JwQh_qbuwCiNqIuMt_iTDz8Tc/edit#gid=621146224).
1. Submit the ticket as __pending__ using the dropdown at the bottom.
If the feedback in the ticket points to something we can improve or change, add a card to __ready to be prioritised__ in our [backlog trello board](https://trello.com/b/c85oxVeR/backlog-accounts) so the team can discuss it at pre-planning. If you’re not sure it merits a card, ask the team in the team slack channel.

If the user answers the follow-up feedback questions, you must:

1. Record their feedback in the __Asked for feedback__ tab in our spreadsheet. You find the matching ticket number by searching for that number, for example "4360500".
1. Thank the user for their input using the [__GOV.UK Account: Thanking user for additional feedback__ macro](#gov-uk-account-thanking-user-for-additional-feedback) and solve the ticket.

### If the ticket is about a technical issue

#### If the ticket is anonymous

We will not be able to respond to the user.

If the issue seems urgent and specific, talk to the developer on the rota about the issue so we can try to fix it.

If the issue points to something we can improve or change, add a card to __ready to be prioritised__ in our [backlog trello board](https://trello.com/b/c85oxVeR/backlog-accounts) so the team can discuss it at pre-planning. If you’re not sure it merits a card, you can post in our slack channel and ask the team what they think.

Once the issue is solved or we’ve done everything we can:

1. Add the __govuk_account_brexit__ tag to the ticket.
1. Add an internal note explaining what we did or what happened.
1. Submit as __solved__.

#### If the user left their name and contact details

If the user is describing a common issue, for example problems with 2FA or confusion about what the account is, you may be able to use one of our macros.

If you need more information to understand the problem, respond to the user with questions and submit the ticket as pending. Use the [__GOVUK Account: More information needed__ macro](#gov-uk-account-more-information-needed) for this. Ask more specific questions if needed.

If the issue seems urgent and specific, talk to the developer on the rota about it so we can try to fix it.

If the issue points to something we can improve or change, add a card to __ready to be prioritised__ in our [backlog trello board](https://trello.com/b/c85oxVeR/backlog-accounts) so the team can discuss it at pre-planning. If you’re not sure it merits a card, you can post in our slack channel and ask the team what they think.

Once the issue is solved or we’ve done everything we can:

1. Add the __govuk_account_brexit__ tag to the ticket.
1. Respond to the user explaining what we’ve done to fix the issue or what we’re planning to do.
1. Submit as __solved__.

### If the ticket is a question about how to do something in the account

Sometimes we get tickets from users who want to change their details or their password. We should explain they can do it themselves, and how.

If the user wants to update their email, phone number or password:

1. Use the [__GOV.UK Account - Changing details (email or phone)__ macro](#gov-uk-account-changing-details-email-or-phone).
1. Submit the ticket as solved.

### If the ticket is about the Brexit checker

This process is still to be confirmed.

In the interim, we should thank the users who sent feedback. If it feels appropriate, ask them follow-up questions about their experience using the account:

1. Respond to the user using the [__GOV.UK Account: Additional feedback requested__ macro](#gov-uk-account-additional-feedback-requested).
1. Submit the ticket as pending.

### If the ticket is not for GOV.UK Account to solve

Upon further investigation, a ticket may not be for our team to solve. For example, if it is to do with other things such as a visa application.

In this case, you must send the ticket back to the 2nd line user support escalation team.

1. Assign the ticket in Zendesk to __2nd Line --- User support escalation__.
1. Tag the ticket as __govuk_account_brexit__.
1. Add an internal note explaining why.
1. Submit the ticket as __new__ using the dropdown at the bottom.

### If the ticket is not to do with GOV.UK Account or government

Sometimes we get tickets that are not about anything to do with GOV.UK or the government.

In this case, we solve the ticket but do not notify the user that we’ve done this.

1. Add the __govuk_account_brexit__ tag to the ticket.
1. Add the __do_not_email__ and __do_not_reply__ tags to the ticket.
1. Add an internal note that says: "The message in this ticket isn’t meaningful. There is no action for us."
1. Submit as __solved__.

## Solve pending tickets

We aim to close any pending tickets that have not been updated for 5 working days or longer.

1. Use the [__GOV.UK Account: Closing a pending ticket__ macro](#gov-uk-account-closing-a-pending-ticket). Change the text if you think the exchange we’ve had with the user warrants it.
1. Submit the ticket as solved.

## Macros to answer common questions quickly

We’ve set up a few macros to help you answer common questions more quickly.

You can adjust the wording so your response ties in to the question the user is asking.

### GOV.UK Account: Account confusion / issue signing in

This macro explains that the GOV.UK account is only for the Brexit checker, and is not currently linked to any other services such as Government Gateway, Personal Tax Account or Universal Credit.

Use this macro when people get in touch because they think they have an account when they do not actually have one.

Usually these people are confusing a GOV.UK account with another account.

### GOV.UK Account: Not getting security code

This macro explains what the user can do if they’re not getting the security code.

### GOV.UK Account: More information needed

This macro asks the user to provide more information.

Use this macro if the initial ticket doesn’t have enough information for you to be able to understand the problem.

### GOV.UK Account: Additional feedback requested

This macro thanks the user for giving feedback and asks them a few more questions about their experience with the account.

Use this macro if the user has given a bit of feedback about their experience.

### GOV.UK Account: Closing a pending ticket

This macro explains that we’re going to close the ticket but that the user can reopen it anytime if they need to.

Use this macro to close __pending__ tickets that have not been updated in 5 working days or more.

### GOV.UK Account: Changing details (email or phone)

This macro explains what the user needs to do to update their account.

Use this macro when dealing with tickets where a user asks us to update their details.

### GOV.UK Account: Thanking user for additional feedback

This macro thanks users for providing answers to the follow-up feedback questions.

Use this macro to respond to tickets where users have answered out feedback questions.

### GOV.UK Account: Issues with international phone number

This macro tells the user to try to resolve an issue with their security code by adding the international dialing code to their mobile phone number.

Use this macro when users are having issues receiving their security code.

## Prepared responses to common issues

### Questions about the security of GOV.UK accounts

Thanks for your question. We take security very seriously. We make sure any information a user submits is held securely.

We have put in place security measures that defend against the kinds of threats that GOV.UK accounts could face. For example:

- all data is encrypted between us and a user’s web browser using HTTPS
- a secondary security code is required to log into an account
- accounts lock out after a set number of failed login attempts
- we store passwords securely

You can review or report any suspicious activity in the security section of your account.

You also can read about how GOV.UK accounts use cookies and personal information in the full [GOV.UK accounts privacy notice](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/govuk-accounts-trial-full-privacy-notice-and-accessibility-statement).

We will keep re-assessing our security measures as the GOV.UK account develops.

Please let us know if you have any more questions.

Best wishes,

### How to create a GOV.UK account

To create an account, you need to go through the questions in the [Brexit checker](https://www.gov.uk/transition-check/questions).

At the end you'll get a results page that lists all the things you need to do for Brexit based on your circumstances.

You can then select the link to set up email updates. You'll be given 2 options: to subscribe to email updates or to create an account.

Select the green ‘Create a GOV.UK account’ button and you'll be guided through the process.

### If a user cannot get an account because they do not have a mobile phone

Thanks for your message.

Unfortunately you cannot currently create an account without a mobile number, but this is something we're actively looking at addressing.

The reason you need a mobile phone is that we use it to send you a security code that will help keep your account secure. We're looking into other ways we could send that code to people, and hope to add this to the account soon.

The good thing is that you don't need an account to access any government services or information. If you were trying to work out what you need to do as a result of the Brexit deal, I suggest that instead of creating an account you sign up to receive email alerts.

To do this, you need to go through the questions in the [Brexit checker](https://www.gov.uk/transition-check/questions). At the end you'll get a results page that lists all the things you need to do for Brexit based on your circumstances. You can then select the link to set up email updates.

You'll be given 2 options: To subscribe to email updates or to create an account. Select the link for subscribing to email updates and you'll be guided through the process.

### If a user wants us to delete a GOV.UK account

Thank you for your message and sorry to hear you're having trouble with your account.

You've reached the GOV.UK Account team - we are the team responsible for maintaining the GOV.UK Account. The GOV.UK Account is the one that you can currently use to save your answers from the Brexit checker (https://www.gov.uk/transition-check/questions). The Brexit checker helps you work out what you need to do differently now that the UK has left the EU.

Is this the account that you would like to delete? If so I can help. I have included detailed instructions for how you can delete your account.

But if you were thinking of a different government account (for example Government Gateway, Universal Credit, Personal Tax Account), please can you let me know what service you were trying to use or what you were trying to do? Or if it's easier, you can share the link of the account you were trying to access with me. I will then try to help direct you to the right place.

**How to delete your GOV.UK account**

Step 1: To delete your account, you first need to sign in to your account here: https://www.account.publishing.service.gov.uk/sign-in

If you cannot sign in because you're having password issues, you can reset your password by following the instructions here: https://www.account.publishing.service.gov.uk/account/password/reset

Once you've reset your password, sign in.

Step 2: Once you've signed in, you need to go to the 'Manage your account' section of your account.

Step 3: Scroll to the bottom and select the 'Delete this GOV.UK account' link.

Step 4: Enter your password and select the red 'Delete account' button.

Once you've done this, you will be completely removed from the GOV.UK account system.

I hope this helps. I will leave this ticket open so you can reply to this email to let me know how you got on.

### If a user wants to update their Brexit checker results

Thank you for your message,

You can change your Brexit checker answers yourself.

To do this:

1. Sign in to your account: https://www.account.publishing.service.gov.uk/sign-in

2. Select the 'Update your results and email alerts' link and go through the Brexit questions again. You'll find that the answers will be pre-populated with the answer saved in your account previously. But you can change this.

3. After you have finished going through your questions, you'll see a message at the top of your results that says'These results are different to the ones saved in your account'.

Select the link in that message, and you'll be taken to a table that shows you the difference. If you're happy with your new answers, select the 'Save new answers' green button at the bottom of the page.

I hope this helps.
